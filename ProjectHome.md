A wx RO-RAIL toolset written in python.

See http://code.google.com/p/ro-rail for RAIL

If you have python and wx installed, you simply need pyRO-RAIL.py. Double click to run. (Provided upon request; most users will want the stand alone executable).

If you are using the Windows Standalone Version, download the executable to a folder of your choosing and run pyRO-RAIL\_vXXX\_X.exe.

Versioning:

This project builds off of RO-RAIL, a lightweight, ultra efficient AI which is still under heavy development. New features are released all the time, and I try to keep up as best I can with new releases.

pyRO-RAIL has two versioning numbers; the first corresponds to the functionality as implemented by the current version of RAIL. The second number is the subversion; this number will increment as I add additional feature sets.

Which version is right for you? I always recommend the latest and greatest version, as it is usually your best bet for proper State file configuration. The best match will always be a RAIL version equal to the first version number of pyRO-RAIL (i.e. RO-RAIL [revision 202](https://code.google.com/p/pyrail/source/detail?r=202) will work best with pyRO-RAIL 202\_x).
